# TODO

- [ ] add watchdog for the whole project that basically checks if all the modules are running and if not, it restarts them
- [ ] add a pathplanner. This should include both the hybrid a* and normal a*. Add path follower logic.
- [ ] add autobahn for both c++ and rust
- [ ] explore the possibility of using a EKF instead of a standard kalman filter
